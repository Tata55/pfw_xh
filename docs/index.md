The Pfw_XH plugin framework is supposed to follow 
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
Most notably for now, that means that current versions
(i.e. having the major version number 0) have to be considered unstable.
So it is strongly recommended against publishing any plugin
relying on Pfw_XH 0.y.z, because that would most likely cause major trouble
as soon as multiple such plugins would be installed in a single CMSimple_XH
system.
Therefore the early versions of Pfw_XH should be considered a playground
for somewhat experienced CMSimple_XH plugin developers, who are encouraged 
to provide feedback on what already works sufficiently and what parts would 
need improvement to be more generally useful.
